## [Coin Portal](https://coinportal.herokuapp.com/)

### Description
This project seeks to address a gap in the crypto-exchange options space by centralizing data. With current information scattered across various sources, obtaining a reliable opinion as to which exchange to use to purchase a crypto-currency can be time-consuming and overwhelming. This tool aims to solve part of this new user on-boarding by introducting a straightforward visual table of curated details with up-to-date pricing information to streamline coin acquisition.

Another focus of this tool is to report the value differential of various crypto-currencies on a daily and weekly basis.

This tool also provides a visual representation of an individual's asset investment gain or loss since the initial purchase.
